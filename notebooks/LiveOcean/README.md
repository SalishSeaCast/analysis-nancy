The IPython Notebooks in this directory are made by Nancy for
quick sharing of results. Focus is on LiveOcean tools.

The links below are to static renderings of the notebooks via
[nbviewer.ipython.org](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/).
Descriptions below the links are from the first cell of the notebooks
(if that cell contains Markdown or raw text).

* ##[Live Ocean Results.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis-nancy/raw/tip/notebooks/LiveOcean/Live Ocean Results.ipynb)  
    
    Notebook to explore Live Ocean results from Parker MacCready and group (http://faculty.washington.edu/pmacc/LO/LiveOcean.html). Goal is to determine a region for extracting boundary conditions.  

* ##[Exploring interpolation of Live Ocean.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis-nancy/raw/tip/notebooks/LiveOcean/Exploring interpolation of Live Ocean.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook will experiment with interpolating Live Ocean results to our boundary. The goal is that eventually these routines will be translated into a script.  

* ##[Live Ocean - 1 month time series.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis-nancy/raw/tip/notebooks/LiveOcean/Live Ocean - 1 month time series.ipynb)  
    
* ##[Interpolating Live Ocean to our boundary.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis-nancy/raw/tip/notebooks/LiveOcean/Interpolating Live Ocean to our boundary.ipynb)  
    
    Development of Live Ocean interpolation functions  

* ##[Working with vertical grid.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis-nancy/raw/tip/notebooks/LiveOcean/Working with vertical grid.ipynb)  
    
    Notebook to work with Live Ocean's vertical grid translated to depths. Loads a local module grid.py that I haven't committed because it contains code that Parker MacCready wrote.
