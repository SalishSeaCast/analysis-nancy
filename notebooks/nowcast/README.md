The IPython Notebooks in this directory are made by Nancy for
quick sharing of results. Focus is on nowcast analysis.

The links below are to static renderings of the notebooks via
[nbviewer.ipython.org](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/).
Descriptions below the links are from the first cell of the notebooks
(if that cell contains Markdown or raw text).

* ##[Nowcast vs Nowcast-green Thalwegs.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis-nancy/raw/tip/notebooks/nowcast/Nowcast vs Nowcast-green Thalwegs.ipynb)  
    
    Notebook to compare nowcast vs nowcast green along thalweg

    The temperature in the bottom of the Salish Sea for nowcast-green is much too cold. Can this impact the density and in turn the deep water renewal?  

* ##[Januaray ssh - nowcast and nowcast-green.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis-nancy/raw/tip/notebooks/nowcast/Januaray ssh - nowcast and nowcast-green.ipynb)

* ##[December residuals.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis-nancy/raw/tip/notebooks/nowcast/December residuals.ipynb)  
    
    I donwloaded recent water level observations from this website.  
    http://www.pac.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/science/charts-cartes/obs-app/observed-eng.aspx?StationID=07795  
      
    For comparison with nowcast or forecast.

* ##[Understanding NOAA tides and residuals.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis-nancy/raw/tip/notebooks/nowcast/Understanding NOAA tides and residuals.ipynb)  
    
    Thie notebook examines the NOAA tidal predictions at Neah Bay.  

* ##[Which constituents.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis-nancy/raw/tip/notebooks/nowcast/Which constituents.ipynb)  
    
    Should we use constituents provided by NOAA/CHS or constituents derived from a ttide harmonic analysis?  

* ##[More on NOAA tides vs my tides.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis-nancy/raw/tip/notebooks/nowcast/More on NOAA tides vs my tides.ipynb)  
    
    There is something funny about my tides compared to NOAA tides. What is it?

    Model mean sea level - nowcasts  
      
    * What is the mean sea level of the model?
