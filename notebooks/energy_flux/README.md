The IPython Notebooks in this directory are made by Nancy for
quick sharing of results. The notebooks and script have to do with energy flux.

The links below are to static renderings of the notebooks via
[nbviewer.ipython.org](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/).
Descriptions below the links are from the first cell of the notebooks
(if that cell contains Markdown or raw text).

* ##[Energy flux through sections.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis-nancy/raw/tip/notebooks/energy_flux/Energy flux through sections.ipynb)  
    
* ##[Barotropic to baroclinic conversion - development.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis-nancy/raw/tip/notebooks/energy_flux/Barotropic to baroclinic conversion - development.ipynb)  
    
    Notebook to develop calculations for barotropic to baroclinic conversion.  

* ##[Time-dependent depth and scale factors - development.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis-nancy/raw/tip/notebooks/energy_flux/Time-dependent depth and scale factors - development.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook is used to develop routines for building the time-dependent scale factors and depths in NEMO with variable volume (vvl).  

* ##[JDF energy fluxes.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis-nancy/raw/tip/notebooks/energy_flux/JDF energy fluxes.ipynb)  
    
    This is a notebook for developing energy flux calculations.  

* ##[Victoria energy flux.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis-nancy/raw/tip/notebooks/energy_flux/Victoria energy flux.ipynb)  
    
    This is a notebook for developing energy flux calculations.  

* ##[BP energy flux.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis-nancy/raw/tip/notebooks/energy_flux/BP energy flux.ipynb)  
    
    This is a notebook for developing energy flux calculations.  

* ##[Barotropic energy flux - total.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis-nancy/raw/tip/notebooks/energy_flux/Barotropic energy flux - total.ipynb)  
    
    Check against Parker's calculations.  
      
    The formula I use is:  
    $  
    Energy flux = \rho_0*g*<(\int v_{barotropic}(t,x)*H(x)*\eta(t,x)*dx))>  
    $  
      
    where $H$ is depth of a water column, $\eta$ is sea surface height, $v_{barotropic}$ is depth-averaged $y$ current, $g$ is acceleration due to gravity, $\rho_0$ is a reference density (1035 kg/m$^3$), and $<>$ represents a time average  

* ##[Develop energy flux calculations.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis-nancy/raw/tip/notebooks/energy_flux/Develop energy flux calculations.ipynb)  
    
    This is a notebook for developing energy flux calculations.  

* ##[Testing conversion.py.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis-nancy/raw/tip/notebooks/energy_flux/Testing conversion.py.ipynb)  
    
* ##[Barotropic Energy flux -- all.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis-nancy/raw/tip/notebooks/energy_flux/Barotropic Energy flux -- all.ipynb)  
    
    All of the energy flux calculations in one plot  

* ##[Hydrostatic pressure - development.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis-nancy/raw/tip/notebooks/energy_flux/Hydrostatic pressure - development.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook will develope tools to calculate the pressure from the hydrostatic relation.   

* ##[Plotting with time dependent depths.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis-nancy/raw/tip/notebooks/energy_flux/Plotting with time dependent depths.ipynb)  
    
    This is a notebook to explore how to plot with time dependent depths.  

* ##[Energy Flux Time series.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis-nancy/raw/tip/notebooks/energy_flux/Energy Flux Time series.ipynb)  
    
    Notebook to experiment with calculating the energy flux time series and then averaging over different tidal periods. Will work with both barotropic and baroclinic energy flux
