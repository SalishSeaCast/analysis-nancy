The IPython Notebooks in this directory are made by Nancy for
teos-10 conversion with matlab wrappers.

The links below are to static renderings of the notebooks via
[nbviewer.ipython.org](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/).
Descriptions below the links are from the first cell of the notebooks
(if that cell contains Markdown or raw text).

* ##[Temperature to conservative temperature in boundary conditions.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis-nancy/raw/tip/notebooks/teos-10/Temperature to conservative temperature in boundary conditions.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook is used to convert Potential Temperature to Conservative Temperature in our boundary conditions. It makes use of the MATLAB gsw library.  

* ##[Matlab and python.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis-nancy/raw/tip/notebooks/teos-10/Matlab and python.ipynb)  
    
    **Running matlab from python**  


* ##[What is Delta S on our open boundaries.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis-nancy/raw/tip/notebooks/teos-10/What is Delta S on our open boundaries.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook is to decide $S_A = S_{ref}$ is a good approximation along our open boundary.
